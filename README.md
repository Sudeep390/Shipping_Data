As part of my Power BI learning journey with Datacense (thanks to Mr. Akhilesh Meena), I built this dashboard to explore Order & Sales Data using Power Query, DAX, and advanced visuals.

Key Insights:
Home Office segment drives ~50% of total sales.
One shipping mode accounts for 58% of orders — a logistics focus point.
Thursday & Friday are peak sales days, ideal for targeted promotions.

This project helped me improve data cleaning, KPI creation, and storytelling through visuals — turning raw data into clear business insights.
